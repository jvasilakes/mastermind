GAME NOTES and TO DO LIST

11/20

Began process of eliminating global variables.
    Created inventory class in functions.py.
    Change all "fairy_key_found"s to functions.inventory.in_list('fairy key') in mastermind_game.py
    global var "left_door_unlocked" will become a class variable under StartRoom. Still a bool, it 
	will depend upon having the talisman in inventory, which is obtained after defeating the 
	first Mastermind. 

   your_name var will remain global. It will be the ONLY global variable.
